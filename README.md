Genii Builder is an interface to create and render Genii visualisations. It is dependent on the Genii component and as such that project must be cloned, built and linked via `npm link` in order to function.

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` or `npm run install`
3. navigate to `localhost:3000`

**NB:** This code uses legacy versions of React, Node and dependencies and as such requires legacy flags to run (these are already defined on the script commands in package.json). I fully intend to update this and companion repositories with modern versions and practices.
